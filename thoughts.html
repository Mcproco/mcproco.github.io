Im caught up in a lot of projects. I have something i am
doing for money, something im doing with friends, and im
working on whatever this is supposed to be. All are
programming-based projects.

I find myself trying to create a system to work between
these projects, but i've only found indifference in myself 
trying to follow these systems.

Who is reading this? I don't know. Why am I writing this at
1:42 in the morning? I don't know. Why am I even doing this
right now? I don't even know html.

I also have a bunch of ideas in mind for small projects, just
stuff like movement controllers.

If you're wondering yes i do call videogames projects because it
sounds more professional
