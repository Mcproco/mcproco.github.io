Its been a while. I still question why I made this- no one is reading.
I spend my free time rotting. Doing nothing that benefits. I find myself
being of a burden. I hate it. I read articles of A.I replacing the only job I
will ever take. And will ever probably get. Sometimes I wonder if its
still worth it to continue. I get outshined by others younger than me, I see 
software engineers making their own job redundant.

Fuck.

My work, my words, my thoughts, my efforts hold no meaning. I appease the crowd of
none. I dont even do things for myself. I find the want to improve at the things I 
do and the things i've never set foot upon. And yet im burned with the fire of my
mere insignificance; who even am i? Does anything really matter after? Does anything
even happen after? 

I am. No one.

Im doing it again. Im destracted. Every second I waste is one lost. Forever.
I hate the thought. Sometimes im not even destracted by the endless feed, Im
destracted by the thought of success. I see people around me doing great things;
reaching heights I cant imagine. And here am I, still in the pit my peers climbed
out of, just... standing by. And doing this isnt helping my case. I tell myself 
that I want to be great just like them, I want to be part of the people others 
like myself look up to. But I fear I can only look up to the dream. For I waste 
away here.

Im caught up in a lot of projects. I have something i am
doing for money, something im doing with friends, and im
working on whatever this is supposed to be. All are
programming-based projects.

I find myself trying to create a system to work between
these projects, but i've only found indifference in myself 
trying to follow these systems.

Who is reading this? I don't know. Why am I writing this at
1:42 in the morning? I don't know. Why am I even doing this
right now? I don't even know html.

I also have a bunch of ideas in mind for small projects, just
stuff like movement controllers.

If you're wondering yes i do call videogames projects because it
sounds more professional
