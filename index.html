Here in this site is where I keep stuff;
Like games, notes, etc. Im not entirely
sure how you got here, but im sure you

I apologize in advance for the horrible
formatting.




I know this looks very similar to uh
*his* website, but cmon its literally
the most console looking thing i've
ever seen
