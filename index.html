                    Mason is an 18 year old attending Northgate High School.
                    (Pictured top-ish left) He plans to continue education in 
                    Computer Engineering at schools he knows for a fact he can't 
                    get into but like 1% isn't 0%
                </p>
                <p class="subtext">
                    He also spent a good $12 for this domain name
                </p>

                <p>
                    After installing and using GNU's free software, he
                    realized just how much software he had that contained
                    proprietary elements. This led to the question: How has
                    for-profit software undermined technology's potential?
