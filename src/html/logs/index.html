                                The kick off meeting was fine. I felt like I didn't learn
                                all too much however. I went in and left knowing basically the
                                same information as before. I know that I have to work on
                                something for roughly twenty hours, alongside giving something
                                back to the community.

                                I am mainly excited about the project. It will be my
                                opportunity to showcase my programming abilities, alongside
                                what free software can do for the community.

                                I am only worried about my project being far too ambitious
                                for me to actually complete. When I have expectations for
                                project deadlines (such as a project taking only 1 month) it
                                ends up taking far longer than what I expect (a 1 month
                                project turning into a 4 month project).

                            The letter of intent process was fairly swift. It was a bit
                            difficult to come up with a project given that it needed to
                            satisfy a community component. Although my project "gives
                            back" by technicality, it doesn't really go too far unless I
                            make more of an effort to spread the word. I was pretty
                            relieved to have my topic permitted. It is a subject that I
                            have been intrigued by for quite the amount of time. I am
                            ready to go full throttle the moment the green light is lit by
                            both teachers.
